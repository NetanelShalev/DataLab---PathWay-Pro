## Hello and welcome to PathWayPro notebook!

The notebook itself is pretty self-explanatory and it all runs under one notebook. The notebook itself is divided into 6 parts:

1. General imports and loading of the data, Demo data
2. Feature 1
3. Feature 2
4. Feature 3
5. Feature 4
6. Outputs

Each part is marked with a header at the beginning and the end, for comfort.
In the output part, you will be able to see all of the outputs we used in our GUI and video presentation, after running the notebook.

Notice that we chose 3 employees for the Demo (cell number 2), but to get the results we got you will need to run them one by one. 

An average run time of one employee is 2 hours~

Also, notice we didn't provide a private link to the collected dataset because the scraping is done as a part of the notebook.
